# travelplanner
Small travelplanner application using GTFS data from Stockholm's public transportation (SL). The GTFS data is a snapshot of one day from the timetable.
The closest path is calculated using the A* algotihm, with a heuristic estimation of the average speed of the different vehicles set as 50 km/h.
